I am a Data Scientist with a strong interest in public policy issues.

I work on econometric and machine learning methods applied to concrete problems such as signal classification, time series analysis or image recognition.

I hold a MSc in Economics from the Paris School of Economics and an Engineering degree in Statistics and Machine Learning from ENSAE Paris.
